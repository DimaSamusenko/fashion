            <p>Minimalism is the trend not for the first season. Excesses,
              pretentiousness and pomposity are no longer held in high esteem
              with the well-known brands, but simple and concise things are most
              preferred for international designers. There are no strict canons
              in this current. There is no decoration in clothes, cut is as
              simple as possible, and the materials are of high quality.
              However, at the fashion week other images were presented this
              year. Lace, jewelry from rhinestones, embroidery patterns, ribbons
              of fringe, contrasting colors, floral motifs. Famous designers
              have shown that in the current fashion should not be monotony and
              routine, "gray" and stamped images.

            <h3 class="inner-titles smaller no-p-t">Trousers</h3>

            <p>For women relevant in this season will be the almost all
              trousers, from classic options to various capris, bermudas or the
              palazzo. One condition is that they must delicately emphasize the
              figure, not delivering at the same time a feeling of tightness.
              Bright and rich colors of trousers will be the most fashionable,
              but the red is on the first place. By tailoring many models of
              trousers are like jeans, blends harmoniously with embroidery or
              sequins.

              cotton dresses, sundresses from denim material and clothes of
              safari style. Sports items can diversify knitted models. The most
              fashionable dresses will be of straight silhouette, simple cut, of
              calf-length, the mini or floor-length dresses. Many designers are
              using drapery to emphasize certain parts of the body, these
              dresses will look very expressive. Drapery emphasize the waist and
              hips, add romance and elegancy to the image. In 2016 prints with
              geometric pictures, floral patterns and stripes will become

              cartoon characters and animal pictures. Many international

              using corsetry items, belts.

            <h3 class="inner-titles smaller no-p-t">Why the T-shirts with a
              large picture on them are dangerous for women</h3>

            <p>While choosing a T-shirt with a picture it is necessary to take
              into account the woman's age and her body type. Large bright
              picture visually makes the figure plumper. An incorrectly chosen
              picture can distort shapes.
            </p>

            <p>For example, a picture of something big on chest, let it be
              flowers, makes the chest visually volume. It is suitable for young
              skinny girls, and it will be strangely looking at women of mature
              years.
            </p>

            <p>If you decide to buy women's T-shirts with a picture, let it be
              small flowers, abstraction, but not figures of animals or people's
              faces. This subject should be left to the youth and adolescents.
            </p>

            <p>When buying it is important to pay attention to the knitwear.
              Dense
              knitted T-shirts are suitable for denim and sport wear. For a
              business suit it will be successful to choose dense, but thin soft
              and slightly silky knitwear.
            </p>

            <p>There are a lot of T-shirts on store shelves, we just have to
              think, with what we plan it to wear. We must remember that the
              right wardrobe is not the huge number of T-shirts but several
              well-chosen ones.

            <p>Today sweatshirt became one of the main attributes of the
              wardrobe of all young people. The story of this thing directly
              relates to marginalized individuals and rappers of the eighties
              and nineties of the twentieth century. But actually sweatshirt
              roots extend far to the beginning of the twentieth century.
            </p>

            <p>One day, son of Ben Russell, who was the owner of a textile
              factory in Alabama, complained to his father that it is
              uncomfortable to play football in a sweater made of wool. In fact,
              people were playing in sweaters in order to give no time for
              muscles to cool down. But it was incredibly uncomfortable, so
              caring father made his son a sweater of thick cotton.
            </p>

            <p>This way Ben's company began to produce these hoodies for son's
              football team. Later, a colleague of Russell came up with the idea
              for the name of this thing - sweatshirt. So the beginning of
              sweatshirts was laid.
            </p>

            <p>After a while, they complement with these sweaters not only
              football, but other sport teams. Russell later created a whole
              production line for sweatshirts called Russel Athletic, which is
              still in effect. Nowadays in manufacturing these sweatshirts dry
              fit technology is used. Later The Champion company began to
              produce cotton sweatshirts with logos of different football teams,
              making them an integral part of a team and fans subculture.
            </p>

            <p>In the early eighties sweatshirts migrated from the wardrobe of
              professional athletes in those of ordinary people who wanted to
              lead a healthy lifestyle.

            <p>Classic sweatshirt models are made of cotton and fleece. as a
              last resort, they are made of polyester. On the sleeves and bottom
              of the sweater is gum, which reminds about the sport purpose of
              sweatshirt.
            </p>

            <p>Long time has passed since sweatshirts were only the things for
              the sport. Today, you can wear it as you want to wear. Ideally you
              should wear sweatshirts with classic Nike sneakers high or low
              Vans. In some cases, it can be worn over a light-colored shirt.
              Velvet trousers or dark jeans are the best choice to wear with
              sweatshirts. And any football club bombers jackets should go, too.
            </p>

            <p>Today all the fashion brands offer different variations of
              sweatshirts. From a purely sporting, to the incredibly feminine
              model (this refers to girls who love the comfort and elegance).
              The abundance of accessories, fashion prints and inscriptions make
              each sweatshirt a unique one.
